My research focuses on the extraction, separation, and recovery of critical metals, base metals, and precious metals from natural mineral resources and anthropogenic solid waste. Aiming to meet the demands of the energy transition and decarbonisation, I have been developing environmentally friendly, clean, and efficient extraction metallurgy technologies and processes. The research is centred on objectives such as non-toxic/low-toxicity, low energy consumption, short process routes, minimal waste generation, and economic viability, with innovations in methods and processes for both improving traditional inorganic acid hydrometallurgy systems and developing next-generation green hydrometallurgical approaches. This research spans interdisciplinary fields including chemistry, environmental science, mineral engineering, and metallurgical engineering.
