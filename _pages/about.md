In 2021, I obtained a PhD in Mining and Metallurgical Engineering from the WA School of Mines, Curtin University (Australia), followed by a three-year postdoctoral training. My research focuses on the extraction, separation, and recovery of **critical**, **base**, and **precious** metals from both natural mineral resources and anthropogenic solid waste streams.

Driven by the global imperatives of **energy transition** and **decarbonization**, my work is dedicated to developing environmentally benign, clean, and efficient extraction metallurgy technologies and processes. The research is guided by objectives of **non-toxic/low-toxicity reagents, low energy consumption, shortened process routes, minimal waste generation, and economic feasibility**. This involves two key innovation directions:

1. Upgrading traditional inorganic acid hydrometallurgy systems through method and process optimisation;
2. Developing next-generation green hydrometallurgical approaches that integrate cutting-edge sustainable technologies.
